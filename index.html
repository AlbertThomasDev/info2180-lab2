                <h2>Why do Electric Cars Accelerate Faster</h2>
                <p id="date">October 2, 2024 by Albert Thomas</p>

                        <p class="p1">To answer this question we have to know how both types of vehicles move. Like 
                        gas cars, electric vehicles need energy to move, and they get their energy from 
                        their appropriate sources. EVs get their energy from batteries in the form of electrical 
                        energy and Gas cars get their energy from gasoline in the form of chemical energy. 
                        Vehicles need a mechanism to convert their stored energy into mechanical energy and they 
                        achieve this by using electric motors for EVs, and Internal Combustion Engines for gas cars.  
                        EVs use their electric motors to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, and 
                        gasoline Cars use internal combustion engines (ICE) to convert chemical energy into 
                        mechanical energy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="p2">Now, the main reason why electric cars accelerate faster is because of torque, the 
                    force needed to rotate an object about an axis. Electric Motors deliver maximum torque 
                    instantly from the start, thanks to their efficient design. They can convert a higher 
                    percentage of stored energy into motion, making them more efficient than ICEs. Gasoline 
                    Engines, on the other hand, are less efficient. They need to reach high RPMs to deliver 
                    peak torque, resulting in slower acceleration. But Why are they less efficient?</p>
                    <p class="p3">Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) convert only about 20-30% of chemical energy into 
                    mechanical energy. The rest is lost. It’s primarily lost as heat through exhaust gases, 
                    cooling systems, and friction within engine components. This isn’t the same with electric 
                    cars which convert over 90% of their stored energy into motion. These losses reduce the 
                    overall efficiency of the engine, affecting both power delivery and torque generation.</p>
                    <p class="p4">So, to summarise, Electric Vehicles are faster because they are more efficient when 
                    converting energy, and have the advantage of instant torque. Gasoline powered vehicles 
                    just are not efficient enough when converting energy which affects their performance.</p>

                <h2>Is your Phone actually Waterproof?</h2>
                <p id="date">October 3, 2024 by Albert Thomas</p>
                <article>
                    <div class="pi">

                        <p>Your phone is not waterproof. Now obviously you’d probably think I'm lying, especially 
                        because of what you’ve seen on the internet. But there are a lot of misconceptions about water, 
                        and phones. And it all lies in the marketing.
                        
                        The words waterproof and water- resistant do not mean the same thing. Infact, the word 
                        “waterproof” isn’t even used in the marketing of your phones, water resistant is. Consumers see 
                        this word and automatically assume that it has the same meaning as the word waterproof, but this 
                        isn’t the case. Waterproof means that water just simply can’t get in it. Water resistant means 
                        that it can resist the penetration of water to a degree, but not entirely.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Now, they actually rate water resistance by something called the IP Code or Ingress Protection 
                    Code, which indicates how well a device is protected against dust and water. The IP rating is 
                    made up of two digits. The first digit represents protection against dust, and the second 
                    digit represents protection against liquids. Phones like the iphone 15 pro and the Samsung Galaxy 
                    s23 Ultra have an IP68 rating. This means the phone is Protected from dust and can survive in deep 
                    water between 1 to 1.5 metres for about 30 minutes. However, even with this rating, water 
                    resistance is not guaranteed.
                    </p>
                    <p>In reality, your phone faces unpredictable environments. Factors like pressure and temperature 
                    can significantly impact how well your device handles exposure. Manufacturers do equip their devices
                    with water-resistant features, but it’s essential to understand the limitations of these protections. 
                    Yes, you can bring your phone in water but it can still get damaged because no phone is truly waterproof.
